# NNLO timeline

Code to produce up to date version of the timeline plot of NNLO
calculations as shown in the LHCP 2016 talk by Gavin Salam.

Usage: the pdf file can be regenerated by running 

    gnuplot timeline-info.gp

This will also execute the [`timeline-info.py`](timeline-info.py)
script, which pulls in information from the
[`nnlo-refs-2017-04.tex`](nnlo-refs-2017-04.tex) file to create the
various pieces that are needed to produce the plot.
